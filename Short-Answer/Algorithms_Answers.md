#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Complexity is O(n^3), this is because the input has been multiplied 3 times prior to running which means that in each iteration it will have to be cubed to check the condition


b) Complexity is O(n Log n), this is because the nested while loop has to meet its condition for each index in the range.


c) Complexity is O(n), although the function is recursive, it only calls itself until bunnies is 0, so the number of calls will increase by the number of inputs.

## Exercise II

I would utilize a Binary Search Tree to find the midpoint, of the building, if eggs still breaks at the midpoint then the floor is still too high, i would go to the lower half way point and repeat until the breaking floor is identified.

The time complexity of this algorythm would be O(logn) because at each point half of all floors will be eliminated as potential solutions.
