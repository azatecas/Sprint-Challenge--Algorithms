#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Complexity is O(n^3), this is because the input has been multiplied 3 times prior to running which means that in each iteration it will have to be cubed to check the condition


b) Complexity is O(n Log n), this is because the nested while loop has to meet its condition for each index in the range.


c) Complexity is O(n), although the function is recursive, it only calls itself until bunnies is 0, so the number of calls will increase by the number of inputs.
